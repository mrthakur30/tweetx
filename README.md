## Tech Stack Used
Next.js : I am using Next.js because it provides tools to build faster as it is a full framework rather than plain react.
Tailwind for styling : I chose Tailwind for responsive design and because it allows for fast writing of styles.
Recoil for state managment : Recoil is used because it provides an easy way to bootstrap projects and is very user-friendly.
Firebase : Finally, I am using Firebase for authentication and Firestore.
